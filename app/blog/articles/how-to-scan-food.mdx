Are you curious about the nutritional content of your food? With the Nuwell Food Analyzer app, you can easily scan your food and get detailed nutritional information in seconds. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use this feature.

## Step 1: Open the App

Launch the Nuwell Food Analyzer app on your smartphone. Make sure you're logged in to your account.

## Step 2: Navigate to the Scan Feature

From the dashboard, tap on the "Scan Food" button. This will open your device's camera.

## Step 3: Position the Food Itesm
Hold your smartphone so that the food item is clearly visible in the camera frame. Try to get a clear, well-lit shot of the item.

## Step 4: Capture the Image

Once the food item is properly framed, tap the capture button. The app will take a photo of the food.

## Step 5: Wait for Analysis

The app will now process the image. This usually takes just a few seconds. You'll see a loading indicator while the analysis is being performed.

## Step 6: Review the Results

Once the analysis is complete, you'll see a detailed breakdown of the nutritional information. This typically includes:

- Calories
- Macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fats)
- Micronutrients (vitamins and minerals)
- Portion size estimate

## Step 7: Save or Share Results

You can save the results to your food diary or share them with your nutritionist or friends directly from the app.

## Tips for Best Results

- Ensure good lighting when taking the photo
- Try to capture the entire food item in the frame
- For packaged foods, you can also scan the barcode for accurate results

Remember, while our food scanning technology is highly accurate, it's always a good idea to cross-check with packaging information when available.

Happy scanning and here's to making informed nutritional choices!
